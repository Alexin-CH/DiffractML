# DiffractML

***!! Still under research & development !!***

This repository contains code and resources for modeling the optical response of diffractive structures using Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis (RCWA). The project aims to integrate advanced computational techniques and MAchine Learning (ML) algorithms to enhance the accuracy and predictive capabilities of optical simulations.
